# Welcome - MCP Community Working Groups

> [!WARNING]
> The CWG Discord referenced below is currently being rebranded to the "MCP Contributor Discord" in accordance with the decision in [SEP-994](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1002). A reorganizing of the concept of "Working Groups" via another SEP is also imminent. Consider all the below a work-in-progress until then.

Welcome to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Community Working Group (CWG) Repository.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is for collaboration among MCP CWG members.
> 
> If you are not part of the MCP CWG Discord, you are probably in the wrong place.
> 
> General questions and discussions on MCP should be conducted in the appropriate official [Model Context Protocol repositories](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol).

## Getting Started

The MCP CWG community is for MCP community members who have been using and engaging with MCP, and want to contribute to advancing the procotol by contributing specification improvements, conventions, and best practices.

To get started:

1. Read the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification)
2. Engage with the protocol and your use cases to build familiarity with its capabilities and scope
2. Join us on the [CWG Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) chat.
3. Start contributing to open conversations or suggest new topic areas in the [#working-group-ideation](https://discord.com/channels/1358869848138059966/1358872476276232242) channel.

A common route to generating a high quality contribution to the Specification will be to 
1. Ensure there is no pre-existing CWG work on your contribution idea
2. Raise it for discussion with others on the CWG Discord
3. Coordinate with the CWG Discord moderators to get your initiative added to the [CWG Project Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol-community/projects/3/views/1)
4. Start a thread on the official Model Context Protocol [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions).
5. Use the CWG Discord to refine thinking and request community engagement with your Discussion, optionally including collaboration on artifacts in this `working-groups` repository
6. Finally, open a Pull Request on the relevant official MCP repository explaining the collaboration that has occurred to date for review by the MCP core team

## Working Groups

Working Groups normally have 2 complimentary goals:

1. To share common practices for implementing solutions with the MCP.
1. To propose changes to the MCP Specification that benefit the wider community.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All participants within the Working Group agree to the [MCP Code of Conduct](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Current Working Groups

See channels in Discord under the category `Community Working Groups`.

## Working with the Model Context Protocol

MCP serves as an enabler for innovative LLM application development, providing interoperability without being prescriptive about application design. The protocol consists of four main components:

1. The [specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification), defining the Protocol and Transports.
2. [Reference SDKs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sdk) that implement the Protocol and Transports to help developers build interoperable solutions.
3. Supporting resources such as User Guides, Tutorials, Debugging Tools and Reference Applications.
4. Working Group artifacts - implementation patterns, configuration guides, and other community-developed resources.

Each component serves a different purpose:

- The specification provides the foundational interoperability layer
- Reference SDKs bridge the specification to language-specific implementations
- Supporting resources facilitate adoption and implementation
- Working Group artifacts enable experimentation and innovation

This layered approach allows MCP to provide standardization where needed while encouraging innovation and flexibility in application design. Working Groups play a crucial role in balancing these priorities, contributing to all layers while respecting their different purposes and impact scopes.

### Specification Changes

The barrier for specification changes is intentionally high due to the cascading impact on implementers. Changes should be:

1. **Well-justified**: Addressing a genuine gap or limitation that impacts the feasibility, viability or sustainability of deployments.
2. **Practice-proven**: Demonstrated in real implementations before formalization
3. **Widely beneficial**: Serving the broader community, not just specific vendors

> **Cascading Impact Principle**: Changes at higher layers in the MCP hierarchy necessitate corresponding updates in lower layers. This cascading effect is why there are different barriers to change - the higher in the stack, the more widespread the impact.

### When to Update Different Artifacts

| Artifact Type                                      | When to Update                                                                                                                                                    | Barrier to Change                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specification**                                  | Only when necessary to enable core functionality or address critical limitations that impact the feasibility or viability of implementations across the ecosystem | High - requires demonstrated community need and proven implementation examples                                  |
| **Reference SDKs - Specification Alignment**       | When necessary to maintain compliance with specification changes or to implement standardized patterns across all SDK languages                                   | High - requires strict adherence to the specification, interoperability testing and cross-SDK consistency       |
| **Reference SDKs - Language-Specific Innovations** | When implementing idiomatic patterns, optimizations, or extensions that improve developer experience within a specific language ecosystem                         | Medium - requires demonstrated utility within the language community while maintaining specification compliance |
| **Supporting Resources**                           | To improve onboarding experience, clarify implementation guidance, or document new patterns that emerge from the community                                        | Medium - requires validation from multiple implementers                                                         |
| **Working Group artifacts**                        | To share emerging patterns, experimental approaches, and implementation guidance that may eventually influence higher layers                                      | Low - encourages innovation and collaboration                                                                   |

Working Groups should assess whether a proposed change is best suited as:

- A specification change (highest impact, highest barrier)
- A Reference SDK specification alignment change (high impact, high barrier)
- A Reference SDK language-specific innovation (high impact, medium barrier)
- A Supporting Resource update (medium impact, medium barrier)
- Working Group artifact (lowest impact, lowest barrier)

Working groups should favor evolutionary improvement through:

- Establishing patterns in Working Group artifacts first
- Implementing and testing approaches before updating Supporting Resources
- Promoting to Reference SDKs as language-specific innovations after demonstrated value within a language ecosystem
- Standardizing successful language-specific innovations across all Reference SDKs when proven valuable in multiple contexts
- Inclusion in the specification only when proven essential for ecosystem interoperability

## Working Group Conduct

Working Groups have open membership, and often span multiple topics. We want to make sure that all who wish to contribute have the right forums and opportunities to do so.

The ground rules are intended to facilitate this without being too formal.

### Working Groups and Topic Areas

Working Groups provide the organizational structure, while Topic Areas represent specific problems being addressed:

- **Working Groups** maintain continuity for a general domain of MCP implementation.
- **Topic Areas** form when members focus on specific challenges or interests within that domain.
- Participants in a Topic Area directly shape how it operates
- Working Groups provide coordination and resources to support Topic Areas

Example: The Hosting Working Group contains Topic Areas like "Multi-Tenancy" and "Scaling Patterns," each with their own participation and cadence based on current implementation needs.

#### Examples:

| Topic Area                          | Typical Approach                                           | Community Focus                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent Interaction Patterns          | Exploratory research with proof-of-concept implementations | Understanding emerging patterns before standardization           |
| Regulatory Compliance Requirements  | Structured development with defined milestones             | Meeting industry deadlines while ensuring protocol compatibility |
| Container Deployment Configurations | Collaborative documentation of tested implementations      | Sharing practical hosting solutions across environments          |

### Decision Making

Working groups should aim for consensus-driven decisions:

- Manage by objection rather than requiring unanimous enthusiasm
- "Yes, and..." approaches over "No, but..." resistance
- Experimentation is preferred over speculation: demonstrate capabilities rather than debate theoretical approaches
- Clearly identify goals for topic areas (e.g. is the aim to agree common patterns, or change the spec?)

### Process vs Content

Working Group activities are separated into two distinct types of discussions:

**Process Meetings** focus on coordination, planning, and governance:

- Each Working Group has a coordination meeting about **_how_** the group operates
- [Topic Facilitators](#the-ideal-topic-facilitator) are identified based on community interest and expertise
- We agree Working Group Topics, and coordinate if necessary with other working groups.

**Content Meetings** focus on the technical substance:

- Content meetings explore **_what_** the group is working on
- Detailed technical discussions should happen in Content meetings, this repository or discord.
- Dedicated time for subject matter experts to contribute

| Process Example                                                     | Content Example                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheduling technical deep-dive sessions with subject matter experts | Developing best practices for securing transport connections     |
| Establishing guidelines for reviewing working group artifacts       | Creating reference configurations for cloud hosting environments |
| Coordinating the roadmap for specification change proposals         | Designing patterns for error handling across transport types     |
| Agreeing timelines and expected outputs for the working group       | Evaluating proposed protocol extensions with proof-of-concept    |

Topic Area [facilitators](#the-ideal-topic-facilitator) help arrange necessary meetings and coordinate group discussions. Facilitators ensure that:

- Meetings have clear agendas
- Technical discussions have dedicated space
- Decision-making remains transparent
- Experimentation is prioritized over speculation

### Interests vs Positions and Problem Validation

Working groups are more productive when members focus on interests rather than positions. This distinction comes from principled negotiation techniques:

- **Positions** are fixed demands or solutions that people advocate for
- **Interests** are the underlying needs, concerns, or goals that drive positions

| Position (Less Helpful)                                                      | Interest (More Helpful)                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We must implement vendor X's authentication protocol in the specification"  | "We need a secure authentication method that works well with our existing systems"    |
| "The specification should mandate encrypted communication channels"          | "We need to ensure data privacy for regulated industries"                             |
| "Transport Y is the only acceptable solution for high-performance scenarios" | "We need transport options that can handle high-throughput, low-latency requirements" |
| "The MCP SDK must support language Z"                                        | "Our development team needs accessible tooling that works with our technology stack"  |

Working Groups should also maintain a strong focus on addressing concrete problems faced by MCP implementers. All proposals should clearly articulate "What specific problem does this solve?" including examples of real-world implementation challenges.

When discussions focus on interests and validated problems:

- More creative solutions emerge
- Solutions address real implementation challenges rather than theoretical concerns
- Multiple interests can often be satisfied simultaneously
- The real priorities become transparent
- Collaboration improves as participants understand each other's needs

> Example of position vs. interest: Instead of arguing "We must implement AWS-specific authentication", share "Our organization has invested heavily in AWS IAM and need compatible authentication options." This reveals the actual need without prescribing a single solution.

> Example of problem validation: For a proposal about tool namespacing and search capabilities, validation would include specific examples of current approaches to tool organization from community members, including where existing methods fall short.  This should also include any available data or metrics quantifying the impact on reliable and efficient tool usage.



### Sharing vs Marketing

Working groups benefit from open sharing of expertise and experience, but should avoid promotional marketing:

✅ **Acceptable Sharing**:

- "Our team implemented pattern X and found these specific challenges..."
- "We've tested three approaches to solve problem Y, and approach Z worked best because..."
- "Here's a demonstration of our implementation that addresses the multi-tenancy issue"

❌ **Unacceptable Marketing**:

- "Our company's proprietary solution is the best way to solve this problem"
- "Our product reduces MCP implementation costs by 50% - contact us for pricing"
- Using working group forums primarily to gain visibility for commercial offerings

Multiple voices from a single entity have less weight than single voices from multiple entities.

> Example: A large team from _Galactic Hosting Corporation_ joining a working group meeting to advocate a specific position, leaving no room for others to speak.

### Participation and Contributions

Working groups enable diverse participation through multiple contribution channels:

- Working group artifacts are stored within this repository.
- Members are expected to contribute to these repositories asynchronously, allowing for participation regardless of time zone or availability for meetings
- For synchronous meetings (videoconference or in-person), facilitators commit to present written representations from those who cannot attend (assuming agreement in advance due to circumstances). This practice respects different timezones and circumstances, and is offered as a collaborative courtesy rather than a formal service.
- The community [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) offers a fast way to ask questions, or discuss topic items in real-time.

### Using AI Tools for Contribution and Collaboration

When using AI for generating meeting notes or transcription, we recommend that groups agree on a single tool to avoid adding noise or raising privacy concerns.  For example, the Hosting Working Group only uses Gemini for meeting transcription and summarization, where transcriptions are only shared among WG members.

### The Ideal Topic Facilitator

- Has time to dedicate to summarizing and organizing information, welcoming new members, and guiding contributors to the topic area.
- Uses techniques to maintain fair participation and encourage group progress (e.g., focus Interests vs. Positions, balancing Inquiry/Advocacy, Decision Making techniques).
- Balance personal investment with fair guidance: If you have strong views on a particular outcome, consider how you'll maintain neutrality while facilitating group discussions.

If this sounds like you—or something you'd like to try—get in touch!
